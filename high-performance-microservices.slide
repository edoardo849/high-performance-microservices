* Productivity augmentation strategies
- work faster
- put more workers
- efficient management

* "Are we actually doing it right?"

* The free lunch is over

* The future in 2005

Back in 2005 the near-term future performance growth drivers were:

- hyperthreading
- multicore
- cache

* The future in 2016

Much of the improvement in performance in the last two decades has come from architectural improvements:

- out of order execution (super-scalar)
- speculative execution
- vector (SSE) instructions

* The free lunch is over

* The solution in 3B
- Better Software (use of multi-core)
- Better Programming Languages (compiled, concurrent and efficient)
- Better Developers (mastering hardware and software)

* Intermezzo: concurrency is not parallelism

* Scaling Computers vs Scaling Applications

- Faster CPUs, more transistors = Scale vertically
- Multi Core CPUs = Scale horizontally

* Scaling Microservices

- X-axis: multiple copies of an application behin a load balancer
- Y-axis: splits the application into multiple, different services
- Z-axis: each server is responsible for only a subset of the data (i.e. customer type)

* What is the reason for scaling?
- Isn't there anything that we can do first?
- Hope for the best, prepare for the worst: set up an auto-scaling group

* Everything is a tradeoff
- Cost of power for vertical scaling
- Cost of orchestration for horizontal scaling (and higher skilled teams) ^^
- Cost of fine-tuning for optimization (and higher skilled teams) ^^
